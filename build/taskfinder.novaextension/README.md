![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/little-green-man/nova-taskfinder/master/.github/images/screenshot.png)

## Features

- _Nova Tasks_ automatically populated from top-level
  - `package.json`, `composer.json`, `Taskfile.yml`, and `maidfile.toml`.
- Per-workspace setting to choose Yarn/NPM for task execution

## Usage

- Install and activate the extension
- Optional: set the global settings for your node package manager
- Optional: set the project settings for your node package manager

_Project settings will override global ones, if you wish to customize package manager execution on a per-project basis._

The rest is automatic! Tasks will refresh when files and settings change.
